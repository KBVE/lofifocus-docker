# Privacy Policy

This privacy policy describes how the Lofi Focus Chrome Extension handles your data. This extension only accesses the URL of the active tab in your browser in order to provide its service.

# Data Collected

The only data this extension collects is the URL of the currently active tab in your browser. No other user data, browsing history, or personal information is accessed or stored by this extension.

# Use of Data

The URL is temporarily accessed in order to generate ambient music tailored to the content of the website you are viewing. It is not stored, saved, or sent to any external services. The URL is only kept temporarily in runtime browser memory and is not persisted anywhere.

# Data Sharing

Your URL data is not shared with any third parties or external services. It is only used within browser memory to customize the music experience and is not transmitted anywhere else.

# Data Retention

No data is retained or stored by this extension. The URL is only temporarily accessed while the tab is active and is immediately discarded from memory when the tab is closed or the extension disabled.

# Security

No special security measures are needed as no personal data is collected. Only the non-sensitive URL string is briefly held in ephemeral browser memory.

# Changes to Policy

If this policy is updated, the changes will be reflected here and users will be notified. This extension will never collect additional data without explicit consent.
