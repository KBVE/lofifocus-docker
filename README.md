## Overview
Lofi Focus is a chrome extension that automatically generates lo-fi music when browsing articles, blogs, and other sites. The ambient, chilled-out sounds create an enjoyable atmosphere to help users focus while reading.

Lofi music, as explored in Justin Wang's study "Lofi hip-hop radio: Beats to relax/study to" offers a therapeutic escape for its listeners. The genre serves as a coping mechanism for stress and anxiety, with research suggesting that such music impacts the autonomic nervous system, potentially reducing subconscious stress levels (wang2020lofi, Page 5). Additionally, lofi provides solace during personal losses, with its comforting visuals and tones resonating with the emotions of its audience (wang2020lofi, Page 12). Many also use lofi as calming background music for various tasks, from studying to relaxation (wang2020lofi, Page 12). Furthermore, its nostalgic connection to late '90s and early 2000s anime offers a unique blend of soothing genres, providing listeners with a familiar yet calming auditory experience (wang2020lofi, Page 4).

## Benefits of LoFi Music
- Improves focus and concentration - The chill, repetitive beats help tune out distractions and keep you in a flow state. The lack of jarring changes also avoids breaking focus.
- Reduces stress and anxiety - The ambient sounds lower heart rate and have a calming effect on the mind and body.
- Enhances productivity - By helping you focus and relax, lo-fi enables you to work and study more efficiently for longer periods.
- Sets a peaceful mood - The mellow, nostalgic sounds induce feelings of tranquility and relaxation.
- Provides unobtrusive background music - As there are no attention-grabbing vocals, it subtly enhances an environment without being distracting.
- Inspires creativity - The simple compositions are unintimidating and let your mind wander productively.
- Helps with sleep and relaxation - The soothing tracks are great for relaxing the body and quieting the mind before sleep.
- Fosters pleasant memories and nostalgia - For many, it evokes nostalgia from times spent studying or relaxing to music.
